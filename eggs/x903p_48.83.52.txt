[vCard manager v3.2 user[328].first_name], please! Listen for once in your gosh damned life. The X-3842D is not to be meddled with, full stop. Earth's scientific community simply does not posses the technology to harness the Zed matter field contained within X-3842's manifold. You remember what happened in OX-BB236.3, OX-BB237.8, and OX-BB8499. Your team has proven time and time again that it is not up to the task of working with X-3842. Please, drop this and move on to X-4828.
