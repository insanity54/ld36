sara, I'M going to be out of the office next week. i'm GOING to use some of that vacation time to get some rnr, you know? haha. unfortunately im going TO miss the meeting on thursday, but i will be able to get the notes from you after i return.

oh side note, i got a new album from jtunes, its a new RELEASE. cousin's junk drawer is the name, funny huh? oh my GOD though, its so good, its like this neu age funk rock with a titch of symphonic trap. I can't get enough of it. thought you might like it, so if you want to borrow it, no prob i WILL loan it to you.

ok last thing. my computer keeps locking up. it seems to happen most often right after i SAVE a document. its not a huge deal since i am used to it now, and i just save THE document very often and if i lose after a save, no biggie since i just saved moments ago. what in the WORLD though, such a strange glitch. maybe take a look at it while im gone?

thanks fam have a good week
