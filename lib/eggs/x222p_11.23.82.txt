Dear Dr. Destin,

I have been receiving E-mails regarding experiment X-3842. I've read the personnel manual and beyond the insistent "KEEP OUT" flag, there was no information. I'm not satisfied with a KEEP OUT flag, especially when the topic keeps coming up. Is there something I should know about X-3842?
