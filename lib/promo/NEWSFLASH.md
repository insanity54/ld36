"Yes Jamie, we're coming up to the Centennial Industrial Zone now. In the streets below us what I'm witnessing is a chaotic sight that is truly out of this world! The large warehouse of what we've identified as Rotchford Electronics Co. is ablaze with fire. We just heard on the scanner that CFD is enroute, as well as CPD, and let me tell you-- this does not look good. The warehouse roof is partially collapsed, and from within the wreckage we can see something strange... glowing... blue.. I'm having trouble explaining this, it's an energy, a shifting energy.. This sounds crazy, but it looks like a spherical forcefield straight out of science fiction! In addition, what looks like lighting, however it's motion is slowed down to the point where I can see the soft edges of the electrical beams fluctuating back and forth. This blue lighting isn't coming from the sky, either, it's coming from within the building!

Wh. What's that? My pilot is telling me his instruments are getting some sort of interference. The hair on the back of my neck is standing up, too. Not from nerves, but from a palpable energy in space. Maybe this is the effects of radiation.. This doesn't seem safe, we have to pull away from here. Jamie, i'll send it back to you in the studio, please everyone at home or work, stay clear of Centennial Industrial Zone until this situation is contained. For Centennial PBHD news, I'm Brian Gillbert."
