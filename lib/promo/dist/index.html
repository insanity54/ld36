<h1>Agents of DECTILE Tutorial</h1>


<h2>SSH</h2>

<p>SSH is not part of the game. SSH is just how you access the gameserver. The account you will log into is `agent` and the password is `password`.</p>

<p>For the best experience, connect to agent@ld36.xtoast.com using a SSH client. If you're on Windows, try PuTTY, Linux try gnome-terminal, OSX try Terminal. This is not a requirement, I have provided a web-based terminal emulator, all you have to do to use it is visit http://ld36.xtoast.com. The web-based terminal emulator is fine for playing the game with a few caveats. There is some input lag, images may be difficult to see because of the bright theme, and copy-pasting the hex content takes some getting used to.</p>

<p>If you have difficulties copy-pasting, try the following. Do not use Ctrl+C or Ctrl+V. Highlight the text you wish to copy. Right-click using your mouse, then from the context menu, click copy or paste.</p>


<h2>How to play the game</h2>

<oL>
  <li>Collect notes sent between in-game characters. To find a note, look for filenames such as "x001p_01.88.77.txt.hex"</li>
<li>Use the Message Archive (MARC) in the DECTILE remote access client to LOOKUP the content of filenames you find.</li>
<li>The messages/notes you find are HEX encoded ASCII (text). Use a HEX to ASCII converter http://asciitohex.com/ to covert the HEX data to readable text.</li>
<li>Piece together the lore based on the story conveyed in the messages. Using the information you gather such as names, phone numbers, usernames and passwords, to explore further.</li>
</ol>

<p>I recommend keeping a notepad with all the information you find. There is a pile of data to go through, and it will help if you compile all the data into one place. Think like a detective, and find out everything there is to know about each of the in-game characters. Poke around, exploring any phone numbers, user accounts, or e-mail inboxes you can find.</p>


<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>As this is a ludemdare game made in under 48 hours, I built in little to no security. If you know Linux, you could easily exit the game inside your SSH session, then browse all the game's source code and assets, leading you to the answers to the mystery. That's an easy way to win, but it's not the challenging or intended way to play. The intended way to play is to only use the SSH connection to access the DECTILE remote access client, or if you know Linux, `./game.sh`.</p>

<p>Using the DECTILE remote access client, you will find clues that lead you to websites and other away-from-keyboard information. In this way, Agents of DECTILE bleeds out into the "real world."</p>
