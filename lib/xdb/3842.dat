Gold Scepter from unknown Origin

X-3842 is a gold scepter from unknown origin. There has been no mention in any of Earth's ancient texts about the scepter's existence, but radiocarbon date indicates that it was crafted around 1500 BC.

Contained within the staff is what researchers have determined to be a zero point energy source. Discovered in 1992, the scepter has hidden from the public due to the unknown origin and curious materials. The staff is made up of almost solid gold, save for the core and the head, which is a metal not naturally occurring on earth. The scepter was considered odd, yet inert, and stashed away up until the past decade, at which time the zero point energy source manifested itself.

The scepter is stored at DECTILE Facility 8A, an undercover research facility disguised as Rotchford Electronics Corp, 12702 W. Dougal Ave., Centennial, MU.

Normally, high energy sources such as X-3842 are not stored at Facility 8A, as Centennial is a highly populated area, and containing such an item would be dangerous to the public. Attempts to relocate X-3842 during the past decade have been unsuccessful. Extraction operation OX-BB8499 resulted in two deaths, when X-3842 was handled by personnel. During this operation, X-3842, assumedly under it's own power, held itself stationary in place, and personnel were unable to move X-3842. The crate and padding X-3842 was encased in was removed, and X-3842 held it's position, levitated above the floor. Heavy machinery was employed to move X-3842, at which point X-3842 released an explosion of energy, killing two personnel.

Subsequent findings have shown that X-3842 is safe as long as it is not disturbed. Most operations at the Rotchford Electronics Co. facility have been relocated. A containment chamber is constructed around X-3842. All experiments on X-3842 are denied as such experiments would jeopardize the safety of the city.
