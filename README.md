This is the Centennial PBD NEWS Chopper broadcasting live from

Yes Jamie, we're coming up to the Centennial Industrial Zone now. In the streets below us what I'm witnessing is a chaotic sight that is truly out of this world! The large warehouse of what we've identified as Rotchford Electronics Co. is ablaze with fire. We just heard on the scanner that CFD is enroute, as well as city police, and let me tell you that this does not look good. The warehouse roof is partially collapsed, and from within the wreckage we can see something strange... glowing... blue.. I'm having trouble explaining this, it's an energy, a shifting energy.. This sounds crazy, but it's like a science fiction forcefield, and in addition, what looks like lighting, but in slow motion with soft edges, and instead of falling from the sky, this is coming from within the building!

Wh. What's that? My pilot is telling me his instruments are getting some sort of interference. This doesn't seem safe, we have to pull away from here. Jamie, i'll send it back to you in the studio, please everyone at home or work, stay clear of Centennial Industrial Zone until this situation is contained. For Centennial PBHD news, I'm Brian Gillbert.
