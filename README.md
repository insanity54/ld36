--- BREAKING NEWS ---

This is the Centennial PBD NEWS Chopper broadcasting live! Below us we're witnessing a sight that is out of this world! Destruction and chaos have broken out in the Centennial Industrial Zone. One of the buildings owned by Rotchford Electronics Co. is ablaze with fire. From within the wreckage, we can see a strange blue energy. Like lighting, but in slow motion with soft edges, and instead of falling from the sky, this came from the ground!

We'll be right back after these messages!
