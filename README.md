REPORTER

"Yes Jamie, we're coming up to the Centennial Industrial Zone now. In the streets below us what I'm witnessing is a chaotic sight that is truly out of this world! The large warehouse of what we've identified as Rotchford Electronics Co. is ablaze with fire. We just heard on the scanner that CFD is enroute, as well as CPD, and let me tell you-- this does not look good. The warehouse roof is partially collapsed, and from within the wreckage we can see something strange... glowing... blue.. I'm having trouble explaining this, it's an energy, a shifting energy.. This sounds crazy, but it looks like a spherical forcefield straight out of science fiction! In addition, what looks like lighting, however it's motion is slowed down to the point where I can see the soft edges of the electrical beams fluctuating back and forth. This blue lighting isn't coming from the sky, either, it's coming from within the building!

Wh. What's that? My pilot is telling me his instruments are getting some sort of interference. The hair on the back of my neck is standing up, too. Not from nerves, but from a palpable energy in space. Maybe this is the effects of radiation.. This doesn't seem safe, we have to pull away from here. Jamie, i'll send it back to you in the studio, please everyone at home or work, stay clear of Centennial Industrial Zone until this situation is contained. For Centennial PBHD news, I'm Brian Gillbert."


## About this project

https://travis-ci.org/insanity54/ld36.svg?branch=master

Agents of D.E.C.T.I.L.E. is a game about solving mysteries of supernatural origin. Agents employ methods such as remote viewing and other extra-sensory perceptions to gather clues and solve cases that no other agency on Earth can handle. Part [metagame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming), players may be required to resort to methods such as placing phone calls or visiting websites to complete their tasks.

This is a game that started during [ludum dare](http://ldjam.com/) 36, a weekend global game jam. The game started out as a [bash script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) which players accessed through [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). This was not very user friendly, unless the player was already a developer/techie/nerd, etcetera. While it lacked polish, the game was completely playable and winnable for end of [ld36](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/).

As of July 2018, the game is back to a Work-In-Progress. It is getting an overhaul focusing on ease of use. [I](https://grimtech.net/about) think it's worth playing for those who enjoy solving puzzles, but don't care to learn how to SSH into a server.
