Agents of D.E.C.T.I.L.E. is a game about solving mysteries of supernatural origin. Agents employ methods such as remote viewing and other extra-sensory perceptions to gather clues and solve cases that no other agency on Earth can handle. Part [metagame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming), players may be required to resort to methods such as placing phone calls or visiting websites to complete their tasks.

This is a game that started during [ludum dare](http://ldjam.com/) 36, a weekend global game jam. The game started out as a [bash script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) which players accessed through [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell). This was not very user friendly, unless the player was already a developer/techie/nerd, etcetera. While it lacked polish, the game was completely playable and winnable for end of [ld36](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-36/).

As of July 2018, the game is back to a Work-In-Progress. It is getting an overhaul focusing on ease of use. [I](https://grimtech.net/about) think it's worth playing for those who enjoy solving puzzles, but don't care to learn how to SSH into a server.
